            <h2>GAME RULES:</h2>
            <p>
                The game requires two players, X and O.<br>
                The player (You) is automatically assigned the 'X' piece.<br>
                The game board is a set 3x3 grid in which players will place their symbol to claim that segment.<br>
                X typically players first, then players alternate turns.<br>
                The goal is to claim three segments of the grid in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
                The game is over either when one player achieves three segments in a row, OR when the grid is filled without anyone achieving three segments in a row.<br>
